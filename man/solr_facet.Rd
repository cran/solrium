solr_facet(conn, name = NULL, params = list(q = "*:*"), body = NULL,
  callopts = list(), raw = FALSE, parsetype = "df", concat = ",", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{A solrium connection object, see \link{SolrClient}}

\item{name}{Name of a collection or core. Or leave as \code{NULL} if not needed.}

\item{params}{(list) a named list of parameters, results in a GET reqeust
as long as no body parameters given}

\item{body}{(list) a named list of parameters, if given a POST request
will be performed}

\item{callopts}{Call options passed on to [crul::HttpClient]}

\item{raw}{(logical) If TRUE (default) raw json or xml returned. If FALSE,
parsed data returned.}

\item{parsetype}{(character) One of 'list' or 'df'}

\item{concat}{(character) Character to concatenate elements of longer than length 1. 
Note that this only works reliably when data format is json (wt='json'). The parsing
is more complicated in XML format, but you can do that on your own.}

\item{...}{Further args, usually per field arguments for faceting.}
}
\value{
Raw json or xml, or a list of length 4 parsed elements
(usually data.frame's).
}
\description{
Returns only facet items
}
\details{
A number of fields can be specified multiple times, in which case you can separate
them by commas, like \code{facet.field='journal,subject'}. Those fields are:
\itemize{
 \item facet.field
 \item facet.query
 \item facet.date
 \item facet.date.other
 \item facet.date.include
 \item facet.range
 \item facet.range.other
 \item facet.range.include
 \item facet.pivot
}

\strong{Options for some parameters}:

\strong{facet.sort}: This param determines the ordering of the facet field constraints.
\itemize{
  \item {count} sort the constraints by count (highest count first)
  \item {index} to return the constraints sorted in their index order (lexicographic
  by indexed term). For terms in the ascii range, this will be alphabetically sorted.
}
The default is count if facet.limit is greater than 0, index otherwise. This
parameter can be specified on a per field basis.

\strong{facet.method}:
This parameter indicates what type of algorithm/method to use when faceting a field.
\itemize{
  \item {enum} Enumerates all terms in a field, calculating the set intersection of
  documents that match the term with documents that match the query. This was the
  default (and only) method for faceting multi-valued fields prior to Solr 1.4.
  \item {fc} (Field Cache) The facet counts are calculated by iterating over documents
  that match the query and summing the terms that appear in each document. This was
  the default method for single valued fields prior to Solr 1.4.
  \item {fcs} (Field Cache per Segment) works the same as fc except the underlying
  cache data structure is built for each segment of the index individually
}
The default value is fc (except for BoolField which uses enum) since it tends to use
less memory and is faster then the enumeration method when a field has many unique
terms in the index. For indexes that are changing rapidly in NRT situations, fcs may
be a better choice because it reduces the overhead of building the cache structures
on the first request and/or warming queries when opening a new searcher -- but tends
to be somewhat slower then fc for subsequent requests against the same searcher. This
parameter can be specified on a per field basis.

\strong{facet.date.other}: This param indicates that in addition to the counts for each date
range constraint between facet.date.start and facet.date.end, counts should also be
computed for...
\itemize{
  \item {before} All records with field values lower then lower bound of the first
  range
  \item {after} All records with field values greater then the upper bound of the
  last range
  \item {between} All records with field values between the start and end bounds
  of all ranges
  \item {none} Compute none of this information
  \item {all} Shortcut for before, between, and after
}
This parameter can be specified on a per field basis. In addition to the all option,
this parameter can be specified multiple times to indicate multiple choices -- but
none will override all other options.

\strong{facet.date.include}: By default, the ranges used to compute date faceting between
facet.date.start and facet.date.end are all inclusive of both endpoints, while
the "before" and "after" ranges are not inclusive. This behavior can be modified
by the facet.date.include param, which can be any combination of the following
options...
\itemize{
  \item{lower} All gap based ranges include their lower bound
  \item{upper} All gap based ranges include their upper bound
  \item{edge} The first and last gap ranges include their edge bounds (ie: lower
  for the first one, upper for the last one) even if the corresponding upper/lower
  option is not specified
  \item{outer} The "before" and "after" ranges will be inclusive of their bounds,
  even if the first or last ranges already include those boundaries.
  \item{all} Shorthand for lower, upper, edge, outer
}
This parameter can be specified on a per field basis. This parameter can be specified
multiple times to indicate multiple choices.

\strong{facet.date.include}: This param indicates that in addition to the counts for each range
constraint between facet.range.start and facet.range.end, counts should also be
computed for...
\itemize{
  \item{before} All records with field values lower then lower bound of the first
  range
  \item{after} All records with field values greater then the upper bound of the
  last range
  \item{between} All records with field values between the start and end bounds
  of all ranges
  \item{none} Compute none of this information
  \item{all} Shortcut for before, between, and after
}
This parameter can be specified on a per field basis. In addition to the all option,
this parameter can be specified multiple times to indicate multiple choices -- but
none will override all other options.

\strong{facet.range.include}: By default, the ranges used to compute range faceting between
facet.range.start and facet.range.end are inclusive of their lower bounds and
exclusive of the upper bounds. The "before" range is exclusive and the "after"
range is inclusive. This default, equivalent to lower below, will not result in
double counting at the boundaries. This behavior can be modified by the
facet.range.include param, which can be any combination of the following options...
\itemize{
  \item{lower} All gap based ranges include their lower bound
  \item{upper} All gap based ranges include their upper bound
  \item{edge} The first and last gap ranges include their edge bounds (ie: lower
  for the first one, upper for the last one) even if the corresponding upper/lower
  option is not specified
  \item{outer} The "before" and "after" ranges will be inclusive of their bounds,
  even if the first or last ranges already include those boundaries.
  \item{all} Shorthand for lower, upper, edge, outer
}
Can be specified on a per field basis. Can be specified multiple times to indicate
multiple choices. If you want to ensure you don't double-count, don't choose both
lower & upper, don't choose outer, and don't choose all.
}
\section{Facet parameters}{

\itemize{
 \item name Name of a collection or core. Or leave as \code{NULL} if not needed.
 \item q Query terms. See examples.
 \item facet.query This param allows you to specify an arbitrary query in the
Lucene default syntax to generate a facet count. By default, faceting returns
a count of the unique terms for a "field", while facet.query allows you to
determine counts for arbitrary terms or expressions. This parameter can be
specified multiple times to indicate that multiple queries should be used as
separate facet constraints. It can be particularly useful for numeric range
based facets, or prefix based facets -- see example below (i.e. price:[* TO 500]
and  price:[501 TO *]).
 \item facet.field This param allows you to specify a field which should be
treated as a facet. It will iterate over each Term in the field and generate a
facet count using that Term as the constraint. This parameter can be specified
multiple times to indicate multiple facet fields. None of the other params in
this section will have any effect without specifying at least one field name
using this param.
 \item facet.prefix Limits the terms on which to facet to those starting with
the given string prefix. Note that unlike fq, this does not change the search
results -- it merely reduces the facet values returned to those beginning with
the specified prefix. This parameter can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.sort See Details.
 \item facet.limit This param indicates the maximum number of constraint counts
that should be returned for the facet fields. A negative value means unlimited.
Default: 100. Can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.offset This param indicates an offset into the list of constraints
to allow paging. Default: 0. This parameter can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.mincount This param indicates the minimum counts for facet fields
should be included in the response. Default: 0. This parameter can be specified
on a per field basis.
 \item facet.missing Set to "true" this param indicates that in addition to the
Term based constraints of a facet field, a count of all matching results which
have no value for the field should be computed. Default: FALSE. This parameter
can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.method See Details.
 \item facet.enum.cache.minDf This param indicates the minimum document frequency
(number of documents matching a term) for which the filterCache should be used
when determining the constraint count for that term. This is only used when
facet.method=enum method of faceting. A value greater than zero will decrease
memory usage of the filterCache, but increase the query time. When faceting on
a field with a very large number of terms, and you wish to decrease memory usage,
try a low value of 25 to 50 first. Default: 0, causing the filterCache to be used
for all terms in the field. This parameter can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.threads This param will cause loading the underlying fields used in
faceting to be executed in parallel with the number of threads specified. Specify
as facet.threads=# where # is the maximum number of threads used. Omitting this
parameter or specifying the thread count as 0 will not spawn any threads just as
before. Specifying a negative number of threads will spin up to Integer.MAX_VALUE
threads. Currently this is limited to the fields, range and query facets are not
yet supported. In at least one case this has reduced warmup times from 20 seconds
to under 5 seconds.
 \item facet.date Specify names of fields (of type DateField) which should be
treated as date facets. Can be specified multiple times to indicate multiple
date facet fields.
 \item facet.date.start The lower bound for the first date range for all Date
Faceting on this field. This should be a single date expression which may use
the DateMathParser syntax. Can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.date.end The minimum upper bound for the last date range for all
Date Faceting on this field (see facet.date.hardend for an explanation of what
the actual end value may be greater). This should be a single date expression
which may use the DateMathParser syntax. Can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.date.gap The size of each date range expressed as an interval to
be added to the lower bound using the DateMathParser syntax. Eg:
facet.date.gap=+1DAY. Can be specified on a per field basis.
 \item facet.date.hardend A Boolean parameter instructing Solr what to do in the
event that facet.date.gap does not divide evenly between facet.date.start and
facet.date.end. If this is true, the last date range constraint will have an
upper bound of facet.date.end; if false, the last date range will have the smallest
possible upper bound greater then facet.date.end such that the range is exactly
facet.date.gap wide. Default: FALSE. This parameter can be specified on a per
field basis.
 \item facet.date.other See Details.
 \item facet.date.include See Details.
 \item facet.range Indicates what field to create range facets for. Example:
facet.range=price&facet.range=age
 \item facet.range.start The lower bound of the ranges. Can be specified on a
per field basis. Example: f.price.facet.range.start=0.0&f.age.facet.range.start=10
 \item facet.range.end The upper bound of the ranges. Can be specified on a per
field basis. Example: f.price.facet.range.end=1000.0&f.age.facet.range.start=99
 \item facet.range.gap The size of each range expressed as a value to be added
to the lower bound. For date fields, this should be expressed using the
DateMathParser syntax. (ie: facet.range.gap=+1DAY). Can be specified
on a per field basis. Example: f.price.facet.range.gap=100&f.age.facet.range.gap=10
 \item facet.range.hardend A Boolean parameter instructing Solr what to do in the
event that facet.range.gap does not divide evenly between facet.range.start and
facet.range.end. If this is true, the last range constraint will have an upper
bound of facet.range.end; if false, the last range will have the smallest possible
upper bound greater then facet.range.end such that the range is exactly
facet.range.gap wide. Default: FALSE. This parameter can be specified on a
per field basis.
 \item facet.range.other See Details.
 \item facet.range.include See Details.
 \item facet.pivot This param allows you to specify a single comma-separated string
of fields to allow you to facet within the results of the parent facet to return
counts in the format of SQL group by operation
 \item facet.pivot.mincount This param indicates the minimum counts for facet fields
to be included in the response. Default: 0. This parameter should only be specified
once.
 \item start Record to start at, default to beginning.
 \item rows Number of records to return.
 \item key API key, if needed.
 \item wt (character) Data type returned, defaults to 'json'. One of json or xml. If json,
  uses \code{\link[jsonlite]{fromJSON}} to parse. If xml, uses \code{\link[XML]{xmlParse}} to
  parse. csv is only supported in \code{\link{solr_search}} and \code{\link{solr_all}}.
